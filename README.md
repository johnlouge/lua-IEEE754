# Lua floating point to IEEE-754 binary representation converter

The repository title and the README title says it all. Includes one function that is returned as per a required Lua script which can be used to return a binary of string type that converts according to IEEE-754 standard.
This function also does not use any external libraries besides ones that already exist.
If there are any errors or inaccuracies comparative to the regular IEEE-754 format, @ me.
